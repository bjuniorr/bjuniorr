I'm a front-end developer and problem-solver passionate about innovation, technology and working in diverse teams. My non-traditional background in retail and management leadership gives me a different perspective with great value to bring to the table while solving a problem. Professional strengths include written and verbal communication with an excellent ability to explain business and technical concepts to developers and stakeholders, adaptability, teamwork, fast learner and customer oriented.
